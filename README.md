# Store Compare
Store Compare is a Java application that helps users compare the prices of toys across several websites. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction and displays the prices from multiple online stores, allowing users to find the best deals.

## Features
- Search for toys: Users can search for a specific toy by entering its name or keywords.
- Compare prices: The application retrieves prices for the searched toy from various online stores, by a web scraper built with Java.
- Multiple websites: Store Compare supports multiple websites, enabling users to compare prices from different sources.
- User-friendly GUI: The graphical interface makes it easy for users to navigate and interact with the application.

## Future Plans
1. I plan to enhance this project by transforming it into a web application. This will enable users to access and utilize its features through a web browser, providing a more accessible and flexible experience. I am actively working on developing the web version of the application and will provide updates in the future.

2. Currently, the application relies on manual scraping of websites to fetch prices and product details. I plan to improve the scraper to automatically fetch and update prices and product details from the supported websites. This will ensure that the information is always up to date and accurate.

## Technologies Used
1. Java: The core programming language used to develop the application.
